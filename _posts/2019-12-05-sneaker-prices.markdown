# The project
In this project I created a website where you can compare sneaker resell prices. I created a frontend to compare sneaker prices by looking at the data to see where you can buy for the best price. This was a fun project for me seeing as how one of my other passions is sneakers. This is a project I can actually use in my personal life when buying sneakers.

# The initial idea

# How I created it
I found the sneaks-api and thought it was a super cool tool. This node module is what I used to get the sneaker data neede for the project. I just created a frontend to better visualize prices. I saw that the creator made a price checker but I noticed that it was too much information all at once. I deicided I wanted to use the scraper to display more useful data and make a more custom frontend. I wanted to display data that I would want to look at personaly when I would be buying sneakers.
