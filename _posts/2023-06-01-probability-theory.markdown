## Reflection
I recently took a probability course in school. I really enjoyed the course and wanted to just review it and make a jupyter notebook about it. In the notebook I went over what I learned and drew out some of the syntax in latex. I also implement some functions using python. To read more and about what I learned check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/GaelGil/algorithm-visualizer)
