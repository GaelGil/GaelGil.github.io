## Reflection
I recently took a probability course in school, and the experience left me thoroughly engaged and eager to reinforce my understanding of the material. As a result of this I have created a Jupyter notebook, which I have shared on GitHub. Within this notebook, I reviewed various concepts, including counting, axioms of probability, distributions of functions of random variables,  moment generating functions, and more. Additionally, I provided illustrative examples and implemented some functions using Python.

If you're interested in learning about the subject and exploring the insights I gained from this course, I invite you to peruse the notebook. It offers a comprehensive overview of the topics covered and serves as a valuable resource for anyone seeking to reinforce their knowledge of probability.
