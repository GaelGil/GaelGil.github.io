## talking points
<br>
In this project I scraped data from a sneaker resell website using Scrapy a pythom library. Scrapy allows you to scape a website take data or information from that pages html but most importantly . For those who don't know sneakers can go for crazy prices after its release weather its a colaboration or limited release or simply just a classic. This webiste allows users to sell and buy sneakers and filter them by year,brand, price etc. this made it easier to scrape data later on as well. 

In my first attempt to scarping the website I came across an issue. That issue was a 401 error code which means unathorized. At first I did not know what this meant I thought that I had messed up something in the code but as I read online I found out what it meant. This meant that my request to access the page was being denied.
