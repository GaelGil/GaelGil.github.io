#### This blog posts refers to the arithmetic mean i'll be refering to it as just mean for shorts

## The average of an array, $$ x $$ can be written as $$ \bar{x} $$ and is defined as: 

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right) $$ 

The notation of here can be very confusing but $$  \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right)  $$ simply just tells us to
add up all the elements of `n` starting from 1 (the sum of the array x). Once we have the sum we multiply
$$ \frac{1}{n} $$ to it.  Which will leave us with the **sum of** `n` over `n`. 

## We can also write it in detail as:

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{x_1+x_2+....+x_n}{n} $$

Written out in detail here, we are adding up every element of the array in the top which will get us the sum og the array,
we have the sum over `n` which represents the ammount of elements/numbers. 


## All together we have this
The prevoius examples showed different ways we can represent the mean and all of put together we have this

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right) = \frac{x_1+x_2+....+x_n}{x} $$

This confusing but this just shows us the levels of abstraction. From being supper deatiled on the right and getting simpler 
the more. As explained this notation can be very hard to understand if you have never encounterd it but maybe seeing it in code may help. 

<!-- using python -->


## Things to remeber
In programing we start counting from 0. 


## C++ 
In C++ we can 

~~~cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){

    int n[] = {10, 20, 30};
    int sum = 0;
    int mean;
    for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
        sum += n[i];
    }

    mean = (sum/3);

    cout << mean << endl;

    return 0;
}
~~~


## Writing everything out in python.
Similar to C++ in Python we can use a loop to get a mean as well but we could also do it in one line as well. 

 ~~~python
n = [10, 20, 30]
sum = 0

for i in range(len(n)):
    sum += n[i]

mean =  (sum/len(n))
 ~~~



## Python in one line


 ~~~python
n = [10, 20, 30]

mean = (sum(n)/len(n))

 ~~~


## Python using statistics library

Python in one line.

 ~~~python
from statistics import mean 

n = (11, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 2) 

mean_of_n = mean(n)
 ~~~


## Differences / idk

This here doesn't really.  

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right) $$ 

and looking at something like this 

<!-- Here we can see that we have a array `n` with 3 numbers and after that we have 
some instructions on what to do.  -->
* First we loop through all the elements in the arary
* After every loop we add the current element to the sum
* Once the loop is over we will have our sum of the array
* The final step is to simply divide the sum by the array size
~~~python

n = [10, 20, 30]
sum = 0

for i in range(len(n)):
    sum += n[i]

mean =  (sum/len(n))

~~~

$$ x = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right) = \frac{x_1+x_2+....+x_n}{x} $$
