## The average of an array, $$ x $$, is written as $$ \bar{x} $$ and is defined as:

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right) $$ 

## We can also write it in detail as:

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{x_1+x_2+....+x_n}{x} $$



## All together we have this

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right) = \frac{x_1+x_2+....+x_n}{x} $$

## Basic things




## C++ 

Getting the mean of 


~~~cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){


    int n[] = {10, 20, 30};
    int sum = 0;
    int mean;
    for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
        sum += n[i];
    }

    mean = (sum/3);

    cout << mean << endl;

}
~~~


## Python 

Writing everything out in python

 ~~~python
n = [10, 20, 30]
sum = 0

for i in range(len(n)):
    sum += n[i]

mean =  (sum/len(n))


 ~~~



## Python in one line

In python we can get the mean in a much simpler way. Here in python we can 
simply use `sum()` to add up the array `n` and then use `len()` to get the
length of the array. This can all be done in one line and can be seen below.

 ~~~python


mean = (sum(n)/len(n))


 ~~~


## Differences / idk

The difference from looking at something like this, 

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right) $$ 

and looking at something like this 

~~~python

n = [10, 20, 30]
sum = 0

for i in range(len(n)):
    sum += n[i]

mean =  (sum/len(n))


~~~

$$ x = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right) = \frac{x_1+x_2+....+x_n}{x} $$
