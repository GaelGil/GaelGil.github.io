## The average of an array, $$ x $$, is written as $$ \bar{x} $$ and is defined as:

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right) $$ 

The notation of this can be very confusing but $$  \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right)  $$ simply just tells us to
add up all the elements of `n` starting from 1. Once that we have the sum, we multiply $$ \frac{1}{n} $$
by the sum of `n`.  Which will leave us with the ** sum of ** `n` over `n`. This

## We can also write it in detail as:

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{x_1+x_2+....+x_n}{n} $$

Here in more detail we are adding up every element of `n` which will give us the sum and
then divinding it by `n`


## All together we have this

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right) = \frac{x_1+x_2+....+x_n}{x} $$

Altogether we have this which as well can be very confusing but this just shows us the levels of 
abstraction starting from left to right where it gets simpler and simpler.

## Basic things


## C++ 

~~~cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){


    int n[] = {10, 20, 30};
    int sum = 0;
    int mean;
    for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
        sum += n[i];
    }

    mean = (sum/3);

    cout << mean << endl;

}
~~~


## Python 

Writing everything out in python

 ~~~python
n = [10, 20, 30]
sum = 0

for i in range(len(n)):
    sum += n[i]

mean =  (sum/len(n))
 ~~~



## Python in one line


 ~~~python

mean = (sum(n)/len(n))

 ~~~


## Differences / idk

The difference from looking at something like this, 

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right) $$ 

and looking at something like this 

<!-- Here we can see that we have a array `n` with 3 numbers and after that we have 
some instructions on what to do.  -->
* First we loop through all the elements in the arary
* After every loop we add the current element to the sum
* Once the loop is over we will have our sum of the array
* The final step is to simply divide the sum by the array size
~~~python

n = [10, 20, 30]
sum = 0

for i in range(len(n)):
    sum += n[i]

mean =  (sum/len(n))

~~~

$$ x = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right) = \frac{x_1+x_2+....+x_n}{x} $$
