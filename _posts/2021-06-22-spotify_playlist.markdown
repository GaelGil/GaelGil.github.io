# About the project
In this project I craeted a python module that creates spotify playlists from the most popular songs in spotify playlists. It uses a some words to search the spotify api for playlists with same words in them. From those spotify playlists that we searched we go through each and find its most popular songs. Those most popular songs get added to the playlist we are trying to craete. I also linked this with my twitter. My twitter reads at mentions and uses those at mentions to search spotify. 
Here is an example

# How I created it
My initial idea was to create a python module to turn youtube playlists into spotify playlists after I saw it in a video. One of the library that was used in the video wasn't available anymore so I created something else. 

# The project
This can be used with and without twitter.
