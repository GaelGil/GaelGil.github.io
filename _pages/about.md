My name is Gael Gil this website here is for me to talk about some of my projects. I am really interested in data science so a lot of my blog posts here will be focused data science topics. To see all my projects you can check my github [here](https://github.com/GaelGil)

I have worked at several institutions, from interning at AppDynamics, to volunteer at local Bay Area nonprofits. Currently, I am attending San Jose State University majoring in Applied Math. Some of my areas of interests in the subject include calculus, linear algebra, and probability. Because of these passions, I have aspirations to become a data scientist. In order further strengthen my knowledge of these topics, I work on several personal projects, most recently to learn more about neural networks.
