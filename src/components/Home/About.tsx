          I am Gael Gil, an aspiring data scientist. Thank you for coming to my
          website. Here you can learn about me, my projects, experince and what
          I do.
          <br />
          <br />I have a BS in Applied Math and Computer Science Minor from San
          Jose State University. My technical interests include math, deep
          learning, computer vision and overall software development
          engineering. My projects mainly revolve around engineering and data
          science.
          <br />
          <br />
          Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to gain hands on experience through
          leadership roles like serving as the technical workshop lead at the
          responsible computing club at San Jose state, creating workshops on
          technical topics such as large language models, diffusion models,
          python and software engineering internships at large companies.
          Outside of technical things some of my interests are soccer, sneakers,
          horror movies!
