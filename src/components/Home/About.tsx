          I am Gael Gil, an aspiring data scientist. Thank you for coming to my
          website. Here you can learn about me, my projects, experience and what
          I do.
          <br />
          <br />
          I have a BS in Applied Math and Computer Science Minor from San Jose
          State University. My technical interests include math, deep learning,
          computer vision and overall software engineering. Because of this many
          of my projects focus on software engineering and data science.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the past, I've had the opportunity Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to gain
          hands on experience through leadership roles like serving as the
          technical workshop lead at the Responsible Computing Club at San Jose
          State, creating workshops on technical topics such as large language
          models, diffusion models, Python, and software engineering internships
          at large companies. Outside of technical things some of my interests
          are soccer, sneakers, horror movies!
