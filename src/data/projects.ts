      "A simple sentence generator built with flask and markov chains.",
    content:
      " To generate sentences we use Markov chains. A Markov chain is a sequence of events where the probability of future events depend only on the current event. In our case the Markov chain is a sequence of words. Where the next word can be predicted based on the current word. I did this by creating a dictionary of all the words in a given text. Then for each word we get the following words and count them. We can see that some words are more common than others. For example car is more likely to be followed by drove rather than person or exploded. I applied softmax to this dictionary to accurately represent a Markov chain. This means all probabilities of each of the next words sum to 1. To learn more about the implementation check out the repo!",

It will then return those movies to the user. I used the OpenAI embeddings model to generate the embeddings for movies descriptions. The descriptions were from letterboxd. I saved the embeddings to a pkl file to then seed into the database instead of calling the model on start up if I had to take down the container. You can see how I did that in ./backend/app/chat/utils/debugging and ./backend/seed.py Additionally the chatbot is equipped with tools to search news or search google for current movies and tell the user about them.",
